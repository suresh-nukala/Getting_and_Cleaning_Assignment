# Getting_and_Cleaning_Assignment
This repository contains R script, summary output file, readme and Codeme files.

### Description about README
## "analysis files is clear and understandable"

This piece of work helps in reading different data sets, merging them together, doing a bit of cleaning, preparing a tidy data set and summarizing the required variables for further anlaysis.

Data tables on which the R scrip is obtained from below location.

This R scrip perform below operations.

1. Merges relevant tables of two data sets called train and test.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

This script can be performed on data obtained from typically wearable computing devices.  Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
